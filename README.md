This is a BT 3.0 SH plugin to pass a text input field object to another viewcontroller using NSObject

AT_BlankScreenD can pass to AT_BlankScreenE

To use this plugin in your own project:
Copy the DataStorageController to your project.  

1) update the name of the classes to your custom class 

eg: change AT_BlankScreenD and AT_BlankScreenE to your class names.

2) Update your appDelegate

eg: from BT_appDelegate to yourappname_appDelegate

3) change the custom classes of the .xib files

eg: change AT_BlankScreenD and AT_BlankScreenE to your class names


add the AT_BlankScreenD to a project, type some data into the text input field and it will load AT_BlankScreenE and display your text input.


Simple but quite useful lesson.
